<h2> Holiday Social Media Posts </h2>
<p> I was assigned the project of making holiday posts for the Cornbelter’s social media. I was given Halloween, Mother’s Day, and St. Patrick's Day, and since they have two different social media accounts, I had to make two different versions of each holiday. I learned a lot about sticking to a consistent style for a brand through the different sketches I made and got feedback on. I used Procreate on my Ipad to make graphics and added text and other details in Adobe XD.</p>

<h2> Game Day Promos </h2>
<p> These posts are to be used as templates to promote baseball game days and with information on the dates and times. Since it was a template, I made them in Adobe XD so that they could be editable to change colors, logos, and information for different teams. I did research on typical game day posts and compared them to previous posts from past interns to get an idea for what I would make. I experimented with different shapes, colors, and fonts for an interesting but clean design, and showed them to my supervisor and got feedback on what to adjust.</p>

<h2> Education Day Flyer </h2>
<p> This was used for printed flyers to promote the Cornbelter's Education Day event. I kept it fairly simple and straightforward to quickly get the message across, as this was directed at children and their parents. </p>

<h2> Belters Buzz Banner </h2>
<p> This is the logo for the new email newsletter for the Cornbelters. We discussed and voted on names for the newsletter with the whole office and other interns, and we settled on “The Belters Buzz.” As I drew up some draft sketches, I tried keeping to the style of the original Cornbelters logo, which is a bit cartoony. I also wanted to include some sort of reference to corn and a bee (buzz). I decided to make the corn from the Cornbelters logo look like a bee, while also tweaking it to form the “B” in “Buzz.” I put that on a yellow background and experimented with various layouts and designs. It was a good challenge trying to find a good balance between fonts, icons, and spacing. We ended up going with a banner that had both corn and baseball icons in the background</p>

<h2> Event Flyers </h2>
<p> I worked on creating flyers for sponsorship nights and other events. The first two were movie nights, so I added a film reel design to the left and right borders that was well-received. </p>

<h2> Junior League Logos </h2>
<p>  These logos were designed for the junior league baseball teams to be used on their jerseys. I brainstormed ideas for team names and logos with the other interns from marketing, and we came up with a lot of ideas. I really enjoyed the creative process of brainstorming! We wanted the designs to be cool for kids and had some inspiration from baseball. For example, the “Sliders,” referencing slider burgers, but also a type of grip in baseball. We presented them to our managers and we voted, ending up with three. I finalized the sketches to be sent to the kids to see if they like them, and the "Sliders" and the "Hammerheads" were the most popular.  </p>

<h2> Education Day Cover Art </h2>
<p> I made this illustration to be used on the cover for the little booklets that were to be given out to kids on our Education Day event. I already collaborated with other interns on the design and content of the rest of the booklet, so I kept to the design of a “kid-drawn” look on notebook paper. My manangers wanted there to be a focus on baseball and children's education, so instead of the usual corn-motif, I came up with 3 kids doing arts and crafts on the cover. I had a girl drawing baseball images, a boy placing baseball related stickers, and a boy in the middle reading a book. I wanted it to look like they were the ones creating the front cover! The managers and other interns really liked the design and the next week we already had a couple boxes of the printed booklet with my art on the cover, which was a super cool experience to see!  </p>

<h2> Magazine Cover </h2>
<p> I designed the front and back cover for the Cornbelters sports magazine. I did a lot of research a based on previous covers and what I found online, and was really inspired by the older vintage magazines. After making various mockups, we ended up going with one inspired by the vintage magazines! It had a double border and font reminiscent of those magazines with the color scheme of the Cornbelters. I had an image of a player which I blurred the background of and placed a cutout of the player on top of the background. This was so I can layer the background, titles, and the player to make a cool 3D visual effect! My manager really loved it! The backcover is the same image for the background, but has the Cornbelters and Prospect League logos on top instead. </p>

<h2> Maps</h2>
<p> One project I was most unfamiliar with making was creating maps of the Cornbelters stadium. These would be used to help guests navigate, but also could be edited to add directions for specific parking for certain events. The maps I made were in preparation for Education Day. This included parking directions, a version with labeled sections and places of interest, a close-up of the seating with each invited schools’ seating section labeled, and a labeled vendor map. I really appreciate vectors now as constantly re-adjust the size of the boxes would’ve been frustrating if it kept on losing resolution! I also didn’t know anything about map making so this was a cool and informative experience!  </p>
